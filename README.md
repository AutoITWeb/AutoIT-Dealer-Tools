## Shortcodes
You are now ready to place the shorcodes on the landingpages  

A shortcode is a piece of syntax that can be inserted anywhere in the WordPress text editor, and will then be processed into some kind of functionality. You can imagine shortcodes as building blocks you can move around. Shortcodes have optionally attributes, that change their output.  
A shortcode is delimited by square brackets, for example __[bdt_cta type="TestDrive"]__
